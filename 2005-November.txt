Message-ID: <436A2120.50004@s3r.com.ar>

Hola a todos,
Estoy queriendo ver si Luca se adapta a las necesidades de la compa?ia
donde trabajo y quisiera presentarlo.
En primer lugar estuve tratando de bajar el .iso del LiveCD pero no hay
caso, siempre se termina cortando antes de la mitad. ?Alguien sabe desde
que otro lugar (que no sea
http://papo.vialibre.org.ar/releases/luca-demo/demo_luca.iso) puedo
bajarlo? (ftp?, torrent?, ...)
En segundo lugar me preguntaba sobre que OS's han tenido referencias que
se ha hecho andar. Es decir, a pesar de no haber revisado el c?digo, veo
que esta escrito en Python, pero lo veo muy linux-dependent (aunque esto
no me parezca del todo mal) quisiera saber cual fue la motivaci?n de su
desarrollo.
Gracias por la atenci?n.
Saludos.

Sir.

I am interested in your partnership in business. This business proposal I wish to introduce you with is of mutual benefit and entirely based on mutual trust, cooperation and a high level of confidentiality as regard this transaction.

I am representing the board of the contract award and monitoring committee of the Senegales Ministry of Mining and Resources. I am seeking your assistance to enable me transfer the sum of US$25,500,000.00 (Twenty five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into your private/company account.

The fund came about as a result of a contract awarded and executed and on behalf of my Ministry. The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign contractors to the tune of US$274,500,000.00 (Three Hundred and Eighty Million United States Dollars).But in the course of negotiation, the contract was awarded to a Bulgarian contractor at the cost of US$249,500,000.00 (Two Hundred and Forty-nine Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) to my benefit unknown to the contractor.

This contract has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the Bulgarian firm is presently securing payment from my Ministry, where our Board is in-charge of all foreign contract payment approval.

As a civil servant still in active government service, I am forbidden by law to operate an account outside the shores of Senegal. Hence this message to you seeking your assistance so as to enable me present your account details as a beneficiary of contractual claims alongside that of the Bulgarian contractor, to enable me transfer the difference of US$25,500,000.00 (Twenty five million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into your provided account.

On actualization, the fund will be disbursed as stated below. 40% of the fund will be for you as beneficiary 60% of the fund will be for me. All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for a smooth actualization of the transaction within the next few working days of commencement. 

For further details as to the work ability of this transaction, please reach me as soon as possible for further clarification.

Thanks and God bless as I await your urgent response.
Warm regards.
Victor Mbaye.
