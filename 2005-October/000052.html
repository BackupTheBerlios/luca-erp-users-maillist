<PRE>Dearly Beloved in Christ,
It is by the grace of God that I received Christ, Having known the truth; I had no choice than to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God for eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God&#146;s mercyand glory upon my life. I am Mrs Kate Lamont the wife of Mr Pointer Lamont, my husband worked with the Chevron/Texaco in Kenya for twenty years before he died in the year 2002.We were married for twenty-seven years without a child. My Husband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home, which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of US $10.5M. (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) with a Security company in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the safe keeping and the management just wrote me as the beneficiary to come forward to sign for the release of this money or rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf if I cannot come over. Presently, I'm in a hospital in Kenya where I have been undergoing treatment for oesophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations any where in the World. Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them. Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand and collect the Funds from the vault. I want a person that is God fearing that will use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house
of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that give. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reasons for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my soundless voice and
presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of Attorney who is in Europe as he will be the one to assist you in laying claims for this funds.
 
Yours in Christ,
Kate Lamont       
</PRE>
