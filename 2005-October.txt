Muchachos,
Estoy queriendo correr luca en un sarge y cuando parece que todo esta bien 
instalado me da el siguiente mensaje de error (y muere lastimosamente):

Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display: :0.0

X me funciona bien, mi windows manager es blackbox, otras aplicaciones X corren 
sin problemas (por ej. Opera).

El problema es el mismo corriendo como root y como usuario ordinario.

Alguna idea?

Muchas gracias por la ayuda.

Muchas gracias por tu respuesta.
Lamentablemente a pesar de insertar export DISPLAY=:0.0 en la primer linea que 
se ejecuta del script sigue pasando lo mismo.
Lo mas extra?o es que teniendo la variable de entorno en ese valor, si abro una 
xterm y en el prompt tipeo xterm &, lo que sucede es que se abre inmediatemente 
otra terminal, por lo que entiendo que la pantalla existe, tiene ese valor y 
otros programas lo interpretan correctamente.
La verdad es que no entiendo porque gtk no puede conectarse con esa pantalla.
Bueno, cualquier ayuda ser? bienvenida.

Subject: [Luca-erp-users] Beloved in Christ
Message-ID: <200510271927.j9RJRtw13705@bat.berlios.de>

Dearly Beloved in Christ,
It is by the grace of God that I received Christ, Having known the truth; I had no choice than to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God for eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God?s mercyand glory upon my life. I am Mrs Kate Lamont the wife of Mr Pointer Lamont, my husband worked with the Chevron/Texaco in Kenya for twenty years before he died in the year 2002.We were married for twenty-seven years without a child. My Husband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home, which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of US $10.5M. (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) with a Security company in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the safe keeping and the management just wrote me as the beneficiary to come forward to sign for the release of this money or rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf if I cannot come over. Presently, I'm in a hospital in Kenya where I have been undergoing treatment for oesophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations any where in the World. Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them. Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand and collect the Funds from the vault. I want a person that is God fearing that will use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house
of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that give. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reasons for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my soundless voice and
presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of Attorney who is in Europe as he will be the one to assist you in laying claims for this funds.
 
Yours in Christ,
Kate Lamont

Subject: [Luca-erp-users] Varias preguntas
Message-ID: <aae5b4ca0510271329w1542c056w@mail.gmail.com>

Hola, estoy teniendo las siguientes dudas con Luca v0.2.0 (uso el luca
enjaulado):

1) El sistema instalado est? instalado en una Librer?a, dicha librer?a
trabaja con libros en consignaci?n. El asunto es que necesitamos
liquidar ventas, me parece que el Luca no trae esta funcionalidad,
pero ?existe alguna forma alternativa para alivianar el trabajo de
hacerlo manualmente?.
2) ?C?mo hago para configurar una impresora en el Luca? ?Debo
configurarla en el woody enjaulado??Recomiendan alg?n how-to?
3)Hemos tenido problemas para dar de alta un proveedor, m?s
espec?ficamente con un CUIT de dicho proveedor. Cuando intent?mos
guardar el sistema nos dice que no se pueden insertar claves
duplicadas (obviamente, ese cuit no estaba registrado previamente en
el sistema). Si cambiamos el cuit, funciona perfectamente.
4) Algo muy importante que no podemos hacer es el ajuste de stock
inicial. Para hacerlo debemos crear un remito e indicar las
cantidades, luego podemos hacer todas las modificaciones que
querramos. ?Es as? como debe hacerse?.
5) ?Se puede imprimir facturas con el Luca? o ?necesito hacer facturas
pre-impresas?, disculpen la ignorancia, es la primera vez que trabajo
con un sistema de facturaci?n.

Saludos a todos y much?simas gracias. Ramiro Laso

Subject: [Luca-erp-users] Urlaub - auch für Sie
Message-ID: <200510301044.j9UAivw25194@bat.berlios.de>

Bestimmt m?chten Sie einen
Gratisurlaub?
Kein Problem. Es geht sogar ganz einfach. 
Wir in Monta?a del Mar an der spanischen Mittelmeerk?ste leben von der
Mund-zu-Mund-Propaganda. Also, wenn uns unsere Kunden und Freunde
weiterempfehlen. Und diese f?r uns so wichtige Werbung wollen wir belohnen.
Indem wir sie mit einer Woche Gratisurlaub beschenken. Nat?rlich auch Sie.
Sie m?ssen lediglich in Ihrem Bekannten- und Freundeskreis auf Monta?a del
Mar aufmerksam machen. Der eine oder andere wird dann bei Monta?a del Mar
seinen Urlaub buchen. Und schon haben Sie Ihren Gratisurlaub. Und sogar
noch Urlaubsgeld dazu. Denn Sie erhalten zus?tzlich eine Provision von 15%
auf die Buchung des von Ihnen Geworbenen. Ist doch toll, nicht wahr? Es
lohnt sich wirklich, etwas Propaganda zu machen.
Sie brauchen nur Ihren Bekannten oder Freunden sagen, sie sollen uns eine
eMail senden oder www.spain-mm2.net besuchen. Dort werden sie alles finden,
was sie wissen wollen. Wenn er dann gebucht hat, brauchen Sie uns nur noch
seinen Namen zu nennen und schon haben Sie Ihren Gratisurlaub ? und das
Urlaubsgeld.

Monta?a del Mar                                     
E-08811 Canyelles / Spanien

eMail
Ihren Bekannten ? und auch Ihnen ? wird Monta?a del Mar gefallen. Es gibt
kaum einen andern Ort, bei dem man einen so ruhigen Urlaub mit den
gew?nschten Aktivit?ten ? sei es nun sportlich oder kurturell oder
gesellschaftlich ? miteinander verbinden kann, wohnen in der Natur aber
ganz nah am Rummel. Zwischen einem der sch?nsten Str?nde des Mittelmeers
und dem pulsierenden Leben des nur eine halbe Stunde entfernten Barcelonas
oder der ganzen Unterhaltungseuphorie in Sitges (gerade 5 Minuten entfernt)
zu pendeln. Das ist Abwechslung, wie man sie im Urlaub haben will.
Senden Sie uns einfach eine eMail. 
Am besten gleich
